# Folders

### Components

Holds the individual components that are used throughout the app. Presentational, without state.

### Layouts

Holds the stateful components that wrap the `pages`. These hold the state, and have the navigation for the different parts of the app.

### Pages

Holds the actual pages that are rendered within the different `layouts`, like the components, we avoid having state in them, making them presentational too.
